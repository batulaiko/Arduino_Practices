First of all, we wrote the arduino code  which I upload here for completing to the experiment in Arduino. Then, we prepared the equiments such as LEDs, 4 x 330 ohm resistors and Arduino Uno for Experiment and set up them to the breadboard like Circuit Diagram that I upload.PIN 12-11-10 and 9 of Arduino are for 4 LD that represents 4-Bit Binary numbers. We connected LEDs to Arduino with 330 ohm resistors for save the LEDs from too much current and voltage. All in all, experiment circuit works. LED that connected in PIN 9 represents first part of binary number (2^0)PIN10 is 2^1, PIN11 is 2^2 and PIN12 is 2^3. We can see the circuit counts 4-bit numbers in binary from 0 to 16 (MOD16) via LEDs.
