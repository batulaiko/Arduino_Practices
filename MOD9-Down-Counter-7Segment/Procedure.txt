First of all, we wrote the arduino code  which I upload here for completing to the experiment in Arduino. Then, we prepared the equiments such as LEDs, 4 x 330 ohm resistors and Arduino Uno for Experiment and set up them to the breadboard like Circuit Diagram that I upload. PIN 1-2-3-4-5-6 and 7 are for Anode 7 Segment’s A-B-C-D-E-F-G pins and we connected them with 330 ohm resistors to their pins. Difference from the other circuit is, we used 4 column and 16 raw matrix for the experiment in the arduino, but we will write 7 column and 10 raw matrix in the Arduino code. Columns are for Output pins, raws for Output images (7 segment will show 9 in the screen. Then 8-7-6 etc.). A little bit organization, we can turn the code from 4-Bit MOD16 to 7 Segment Counter MOD9 but it counts from 9 to 0.
