# Arduino Practices

## 1. [Arduino INPUT](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/Analog_INPUT)

Example of blinking a LED via Arduino IDE

## 2. [Arduino Blinking LED](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/Arduino-Blinking-LED)

Example of ANALOG Input and PWM Outputs of Arduino. Purpose of experiment is to control LED's luminosity via potentiometer.

## 3. [Blink Speed Without Map Code](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/Blink_Speed_Without_Map_Code)

In the code, we are calibrating the speed of blinking led with pot without "map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh); ". When the potentiometer goes to 0 Volt, then the speed of blinking will increase to 2 seconds. If the pot goes to 5 Volts, then speed of blinking will reduces to 0.2 seconds.

## 4. [Button Experiment](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/Button-Experiment)

When we push the button once, then LED will be on. After releasing the button, LED saves its status. When we push the button again, LED will be off.

## 5. [Fading LED](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/Fading_LED)

Example of ANALOG Input and PWM Outputs of Arduino, LED gets output value between 0-255 and decreases 255 to 0.


## 6. [HelloWorld LCD](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/HelloWorld-LCD)

Example of using LCD with Arduino. In first raw of LCD, "hello world" will be written and in second raw, code will count from 0 to how many code can counts.


## 7. [MOD9 Down Counter 7Segment](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/MOD9-Down-Counter-7Segment)

Example of MOD9 Down Counter. The aim of the experiment is, examine the “boolean” code, how it makes the writing the code simple and learn the areas of “boolean” code to use.


## 8. [Volt_Pot_Percentage](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/Volt_Pot_Percentage)

Example of LCD that showing the Voltage value which comes from PWM PIN and its percentage between 0 and 16 " * " .


## 9. [VoltLevel_Potentiometer](https://github.com/batulaiko/Arduino_Practices/tree/main/VoltLevel_Potentiometer)

In this code, we are determining the Value that from PWM PIN between 0.00 - 5.00 instead of 0-1023 and watching the value in Serial Monitor
